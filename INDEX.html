<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Early and personal life</h1>

<p>Djokovic was born on 22 May 1987 in Belgrade, SR Serbia, Yugoslavia, to parents Srdan and Dijana (née Žagar). He is of paternal Montenegrin and maternal Croatian descent.[a] His two younger brothers, Marko and Djordje, are also tennis players with professional aspirations.A resident of Monte Carlo, Djokovic was coached by former Slovak tennis player Marián Vajda from 2006 until Boris Becker took over the role of head coach in December2013. Djokovic is a self-described fan of languages, speaking Serbian, English, French, German, and Italian.He met his future wife, Jelena Ristic, in high school, and began dating her in 2005.The two became engaged in September 2013, and on 10 July 2014 the couple got married on Sveti Stefan in Montenegro, while a church wedding was held in the same place, on 12 July 2014, in the Church of Saint Stephen which belongs to Praskvica Monastery. On 24 April 2014, Djokovic announced that he and Ristic were expecting their first child. Their son, Stefan,was born in October 2014.Their daughter, Tara, was born in September 2017.Djokovic began playing tennis at the age of four.In the summer of 1993, the six-year-old was spotted by Yugoslav tennis player Jelena Gencic at Mount Kopaonik,where Djokovic's parents ran a fast-food parlour.Upon seeing the child Djokovic playing tennis, she stated: "This is the greatest talent I have seen since MonicaSeles.Gencic worked with young Djokovic over the following six years before realizing that, due to his rapid development, going abroad in search of increased level ofcompetition was the best option for his future. To that end, she contacted Nikola Pilic and in September 1999 the 12-year-old moved to the Pilic tennis academy in berschleißheim, Germany, spending four years there.At the age of 14, he began his international career, winning European championships in singles, doubles, and team competition.Djokovic is known for his often humorous off-court impersonations of his fellow players, many of whom are his friends.This became evident to the tennis world after his2007 US Open quarterfinal win over Carlos Moyá, where he entertained the audience with impersonations of Rafael Nadal and Maria Sharapova. His impersonations have alsobecome popular onYouTube.Djokovic did an impression of John McEnroe after his fourth round match victory at the 2009 US Open, before playing a brief game withMcEnroe, much to the delight of the audience.Djokovic is a member of the "Champions for Peace" club, a group of famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in theworld through sport, created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization.Djokovic is a member of the Serbian Orthodox Church. On 28 April 2011, Patriarch Irinej of Serbia awarded Djokovic the Order of St. Sava I class, the highest decoration of the Serbian Orthodox Church, for his contributions to monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo and Metohija and charitable work in Serbia. Heis a keen fan of Serbian football club Red Star Belgrade,Italian club A.C. Milan and Portuguese club S.L. Benfica. He is good friends with fellow Serbian tennis playerAna Ivanovic, whom he has known since the two were children growing up in Serbia, through Djokovic's uncle and Ivanovic's father.Djokovic has been reported to meditate for up to an hour a day at the Buddhist Buddhapadipa Temple in Wimbledon, and is close to monks in the complex. He has spoken ofthe positive power of meditation.</p>

<h1 style="color:Tomato;">Place among the all-time greats</h1>

<p>Djokovic is considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time. Following his tremendous success in the 2011 season, he began to feature on all-time greatest lists and, in late 2011, Rod Laver listed Djokovic number six in his top ten male players of the Open Era. According to Tim Henman's June 2012 statement, Djokovic is "probably a top eight player in tennis history".Andre Agassi stated in September 2012 that Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic "may very well be the greatest three players to ever play tennis". In March 2012, contemporary competitor Andy Murray described Djokovic as 'one of the greatest players ever'. In his September 2013 men's greatest players of all-time list, International Business Times' writer Jason Le Miere put the Serb in seventh place.In January 2014, ESPN writer Howard Bryant called him 'arguably the best pure tennis player in the world'.

In April 2015, Henman offered another comment on Djokovic's standing among the all-time greats, saying "it's only a matter of time before he is considered alongside Federer and Nadal as one of the greatest players of all time".Having proclaimed him "one of the all-time greats" in November 2014,John McEnroe put Djokovic in all-time top five following his 2015 Wimbledon win, Djokovic's ninth Grand Slam tournament title: "My top four are Laver, Sampras, Roger and Nadal but Novak is at number five and rising". Andrew Castle stated in January 2016 that Djokovic is "undoubtedly moving towards being considered the sport's all-time greatest player".In June 2016, a panel of more than forty ESPN experts ranked Djokovic as number eight on their top twenty all-time combined list of both male and female tennis players; he was number five among the males, behind Federer, Laver, Sampras, and Borg.Rod Laver said in 2016 that Djokovic was tied with Federer as the best player of all time. In February 2018, Djokovic got placed No. 5 by Tennis.com in their list of 50 greatest male players of the Open era, behind Federer, Laver, Nadal, and Sampras.

Djokovic is widely considered to be one of the greatest returners in the history of the sport,an accolade given to him even by Andre Agassi, who was considered to be the best returner ever. Though staying clear of best ever conversations,tennis coach Nick Bollettieri has continually been praising Djokovic as the "most complete player ever"and the "most perfect player of all time":
When you look at match players in the history of tennis, I don't believe that anybody can equal everything on the court that Djokovic does. I don't think you can find a weakness in his game. His movement, personality, his return of serve, his serve, excellent touch, not hesitant in coming to the net, great serve. Over all, almost every player has a downfall; to me he doesn't have one. He's perhaps the best put-together player that I've seen over 60 years.

Tennis pundits have classified many of Djokovic's matches as some of the greatest contests ever, with the 2012 Australian Open final being considered one of the greatest matches ever seen.Some longtime analysts claim that the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry ranks as the best rivalry in tennis history primarily because of the quality of matches they produce.</p>
